# Web-Application-for-Encryption

Proposed a website that allows users to enter text and encrypt it by using various cryptographic techniques along with the ability to view the ciphertext. The encryption will be implemented using PHP along with setting up a database to store the user feedback. The system does not check for any authentication, any user can encrypt and try various symmetric encryption algorithms and download the code for the chosen algorithms in various languages.
